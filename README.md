# Day1 
### 1. Supervised learning
Learns from being given `right answers`.  
Supervised machine learning is based on the basis of labeled data.First the data is fed to the model with both input and output and later on test data is given to make prediction by model. 
some algorithm used in supervised learning with their uses are :  
* Regression : House price prediction.
* Classification : Breast cancer detection.  
### 2. Unsupervised learning  
Learns by finding pattern in unlabelled data.
Unsupervised learning is different from supervised learning as it is not provided with labelled data.The algorithm work by finding pattern in data.  
some algorithm used in unsupevised learning with it uses are:
* Clustering : Grouping similar data points together e.g: grouping of customer , grouping of news,DNA microarray.
* Anomlay detection: Finding unusal data points e.g: fraud detection , quality check.
* Dimensionality reduction : Compress data using feweer numbers e.g : Image processing.

# Day2
### Univariate Linear regression  
Univariate linear regression has one dependent variable and one independent variable. With the help of indendent variable also known as input,feature we predict the output. Firstly we provide training set to our model and later on we predict the output using training set.
### Cost function   
A cost function is a measure of how well a machine learning model performs by quantifying the difference between predicted and actual outputs.  
`lower the value of cost function better the model`  
![cost function](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/276707b43ff92bd2f822312e545e90d26c4358c9/images/day2%20costfunction.png)

# Day4
### Learning rate
Learning rate `alpha` in gradient descent should be optimal.
* If learning rate is too small gradient descent may be too slow and take much time.  
* If learning rate is too large gradient descent may overshoot and never reach minimum i.e fail to converge,diverge.  
![learning rate](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/2fd63f02907afd95dfec81f13eb576065a5a0f29/images/day4%20learning%20rate.png)

### Multiple linear regression
Multiple linear regression in machine learning model that uses multiple variables called as features to predicts the output.
![multiple linear regression model](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/41535e5806b7fc119dc833a4486e6e7d15e9bfbe/images/day5%20multiple%20linear%20regression.png)
### Vectorization 
In muliple linear regression calculation is done using vectorization as it perform all calculation simultaneously and parallely and speed up the arithmetic operations.
![vectorization img](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/41535e5806b7fc119dc833a4486e6e7d15e9bfbe/images/day5%20vectorization.png)

# Day6
### Feature scaling 
When you data features has very large range,too small range gradient descent may take large time so data is rescaled to normal similar range called feature scaling.
some popular feature scaling techniques are:  
* mean normalization
* Z score normalization  
![feature scaling type](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/4291831060fcce086ac8677076c92803d42d9fb6/images/day6%20feature%20scaling%20techniques.png)

### Choosing correct learning rate 
First we make sure gradient descent is decreasing over the iteration by looking at learning curve if it is working properly we choose correct learning rate by starting with smaller learning rate and increase it gradually.
* [feature scaling  and learning rate](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/a5fad158c61e2bc72d1d088909a9ba4aafd4e92a/code/day6%20feature%20scaling%20and%20choosing%20learning%20rate.ipynb)

# Day7
### Feature engineering 
Feature engineering means designing newfeatures by transforming or combining original features which maybe very important in prediciting the output.  
for e.g: we have to predict the price of swimming pool and we have length breadth and height of swimming pool as features now we can used feature engineering to create our new feature which is volume which is very important in predicting the price of swimming pool.
### Polynomial regression
Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:

### Classification
Classification is a type of supervised learning in machine learning, where the goal is to predict the class label of an input data point.For example, we may want to classify emails as spam or not spam, or classify images as cats or dogs.
### Logistic regression  
Logistic regression is a type of algorithm used for classification problems. It works by estimating the probability of an input data point belonging to a particular class. For example, it may estimate the probability that an email is spam or not spam, or the probability that an image is a cat or a dog.

To estimate these probabilities, logistic regression uses a mathematical function called the logistic function, which maps the input data to the probability space. The logistic regression algorithm then learns the relationships between the input features and the target class by adjusting weights, or coefficients, assigned to each input feature. These weights are adjusted to maximize the probability of the correct classification.

In the end, logistic regression outputs the predicted class for each input data point, based on the estimated probabilities. This can be useful for a wide range of classification tasks, from predicting diseases to detecting fraud.

# Day9
### Sigmoid function
The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1. It is commonly used in logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome. The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve and is defined as follows:

œÉ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

where z is the input value to the function. The output of the sigmoid function, œÉ(z), is a value between 0 and 1, with a midpoint at z=0.

The sigmoid function has several important properties that make it useful in logistic regression. First, it is always positive and ranges between 0 and 1, which makes it suitable for modeling probabilities. Second, it is differentiable, which means that it can be used in optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. Finally, it has a simple derivative that can be expressed in terms of the function itself:

d/dz œÉ(z) = œÉ(z) * (1 - œÉ(z))

This derivative is used in logistic regression to update the model coefficients during the optimization process. 
* [Sigmoid function](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/8030ab207dc51472a4ad8cc13fd211587132a4ee/code/day8%20sigmoid%20function.ipynb)
### Decision boundary
The decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y=0 and where y=1.It is create by our hypothesis function.
In logistic regression, the decision boundary is the line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates the different classes of the target variable. The decision boundary is determined by the logistic regression model, which uses the input variables to predict the probability of belonging to a certain class.  
![decision boundary image](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/55bb303deeace7b4800319a38312bfe0202fc59d/images/day9%20decision%20boundary.png)

### Gradient descent in Logistic regression  
Logistic Regression ≈∂i is a nonlinear function(≈∂=1‚Äã/1+ e-z), if we put this in the above MSE equation it will give a non-convex function as shown:  
![loss function image](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/a3e7cb1c6715f32f4f2744083b8eb6f69374f56c/images/day10%20cost%20function%20in%20logistic%20regression.jpg)
* When we try to optimize values using gradient descent it will create complications to find global minima.

* Another reason is in classification problems, we have target values like 0/1, So (≈∂-Y)2 will always be in between 0-1 which can make it very difficult to keep track of the errors and it is difficult to store high precision floating numbers.

The cost function used in Logistic Regression is Log Loss.  
![log loss image](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/a3e7cb1c6715f32f4f2744083b8eb6f69374f56c/images/day10%20logloss.png)

### Gradient Descent in logistic regression  
Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression is an iterative optimisation algorithm used to find the local minimum of a function. It works by tweaking parameters w and b iteratively to minimize a cost function by taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient at the current point.  
Gradient descent in logistic regression looks similar to gradient descent in linear regression but it has different value for function.

In neural network.
* neuron is represneted by subscript.
* neural network layer is represented by superscript.
### Forward propagation in neural network  
Forward propagation refers to storage and calculation of input data which is fed in forward direction through the network to generate an output. Hidden layers in neural network accepts the data from the input layer, process it on the basis of activation function and pass it to the output layer or the successive layers. Data flows in forward direction so as to avoid circular shape flow of data which will not generate an output. The network configuration that helps in forward propagation is known as feed-forward network.

### Activation function
There are different activation function for different purpose some of the most commonly used are :  
* Linear acitvation function(activation='linear')  
This is used for regression problem where result is negative/positive.
* ReLU (activation = 'ReLU')  
This is used for regression problem where result should be positive always and it is faster as compared to sigmoid function.
* Sigmoid function(activation='sigmoid')   
It is used for classification problems where result must be on/off and it is slowere as compared to ReLU.  
NOTE:`For hidden layer we choose ReLU as activation and for output layer we choose activation according to our problems,because if we choose sigmoid in hidden layer than neural network becomes very slow so it better to choose Relu in hidden layer`

### MultiLabel classification
Multilabel classification is a type of classification problem in machine learning where each instance can be assigned to multiple classes or labels simultaneously. In other words, instead of predicting a single class for an instance, the goal is to predict a set of labels that are applicable to that instance.   
Here is difference between multiclass and multilable classfication

### Advanced optimization
Adam algorithm is used for advanced optimization in neural network.
* If learning rate is smaller adam algorithm increases it automatically.
* If learning rate is larger then adam algorithm decreases it automatically.
Note : It stands for Adaptive Moment estimation.
It is used as:  
```python
model.compile( optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3), loss = tf.kearas.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True))
```

### Additional Layer types:
Some of layer types of neural network are : 
* Dense Layer (Fully Connected Layer): A dense layer is a basic layer where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. It is characterized by its weight matrix, bias vector, and activation function. Dense layers are commonly used in feedforward neural networks and can learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.

* Convolutional Layer: Convolutional layers are primarily used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analyzing grid-like data, such as images. These layers perform convolutions, applying filters to the input data, and capturing local patterns and features. Convolutional layers are effective in image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.   
Convaulational neural network are faster in computation and need less training data as compared to Dense Layer.

### Back Propagation  
Backpropagation, or backward propagation of errors, is an algorithm used in machine learning to adjust the parameters of a neural network by calculating the gradients of a loss function with respect to the network's weights and biases. It propagates the error from the output layer to the input layer, allowing the network to learn and improve its predictions.

### Error analysis
It is the process to isolate,observe and diagnose erroneous ML predictions to understand pockets of high and low performance to the model.
### Adding more data
Adding more data is mostly useful to make better predictions and data can be added by following ways:  
1. Data augmentation: Modifying an existing training example to create new training example. e.g: Data augmentation by adding distortion.  
2. Data synthesis: Using artifical data inputs to create a new training example. It is mostly used for computer vision applications.
### Transfer learning 
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.  
It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems.
* Download neural network parameters pretrained on large dataset with same input type (e.g: images,audio,text) as your application (or train your own).

### Decision Tree
A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered. The model is a form of supervised learning, meaning that the model is trained and tested on a set of data that contains the desired categorization. 
![decision tree image](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/c47f3b6ac073db8e2d634ef749042dca8ad9eab2/images/day25%20decision%20tree.png)

# Day26
### Measuring purity
In decision tree entropy is the measure of level of impurity and helps to find purity of classes. lower impurity means higher purity.  
![entropy](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/e3a817ab172d6abf9c552365c2842ed09621a314/images/day26%20entropy%20as%20impurity.png)
### Information gain
We can calculate the information gain by subtracting the weighted average entropy of the resulting subsets from the entropy of the original node. The formula for information gain is:  
Information Gain = Entropy(node) - Œ£((subset_size/total_size) * Entropy(subset))  
* By maximizing information gain, decision trees aim to find the attribute that provides the most useful and informative splits, leading to more accurate classification.
### Decision tree learning
* Start with all examples at the root node
* Calculate information gain for all possible features, and pick the one with the highest information gain
* Split dataset according to selected feature, and create left and right branches of the tree
Keep repeating splitting process until stopping criteria is met:
1. When a node is 100% one class  
2. 2. When splitting a node will result in the tree exceeding a maximum depth  
3. 3. Information gain from additional splits is less than threshold When number of examples in a node is below a threshold

# Recursive splitting
Recursive splitting refers to the iterative process in decision tree construction where a dataset is divided into smaller subsets based on specific conditions. It involves recursively selecting attributes to split on and creating branches that further partition the data until a stopping criterion is met, resulting in a tree-like structure.

### One hot encoding
If a categorical features can take on k values, create k binary features(0 or 1 values) is call one hot encoding.
### Spitting for continuous variable
For continuous variable we have to choose threshold with higher information gain and split on the basis of that threshold.
### Regression tree
It is a decision based tree used to predict continous variables.
* for selecting best split for regression tree we find variance reduction and the biggest variance reduction is considerd to be the best split.
* Note: Variance reduction = variance of root node - average weighted variance of leaf node

### Tree ensemble 
Single decision tree is very sensitive to data so the process of combining many decision tree to build more robust system is called tree ensemble.
the prediciton of tree ensemble is obtained by majority result of tree.
### Random forest algorithm
A random forest algorithm is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to make more accurate and robust predictions. It works by creating an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and uses a random subset of features. The final prediction is then made by averaging or voting the predictions of all the trees in the forest. The random forest algorithm is effective at handling complex datasets, handling missing values, and avoiding overfitting.
* Random forest has two term that explain this algorithm they are Bootstrapping and aggregation and the combination of this is called Bagging
* Boostrap : The selection of subset of training example (sampling with replacement) where the training example can be repeatded is called bootstrap
* Aggregation : The selection of majority of result from ensembles tree is called aggregation.

### When to use decision tree

### Unsupervised learning
Machine leanring algorithm that find patterns on unlabelled data.
### K-means Clustering Algorithm
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct non-overlapping clusters. Each data point in the dataset is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster variance, also known as the "inertia."

Here's a step-by-step overview of the k-means clustering algorithm:

* Initialization: Randomly select K data points from the dataset as the initial cluster centroids.

* Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. This is done by calculating the Euclidean distance (or other distance metrics) between each data point and each centroid, and assigning the data point to the cluster with the closest centroid.

* Update: Recalculate the centroids of each cluster by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to that cluster.

* Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer move significantly between iterations or when the algorithm reaches the predefined maximum number of iterations.

* Final Clusters: Once convergence is achieved, the algorithm outputs the final cluster assignments, where each data point belongs to one of the K clusters.  
![k means cluster](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/0b42f7fba067ff92974b209532654e381edc8996/images/day29%20k%20means%20clustering.png)
### Cost function for k-means clustering(distortion)
The cost function for k-means clustering is commonly referred to as the "inertia" or "within-cluster sum of squares." It measures the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid within each cluster. The goal of k-means clustering is to minimize this cost function.

Mathematically, the cost function (J) for k-means clustering can be defined as:

J = Œ£·µ¢ Œ£‚±º ||x·µ¢ - Œº‚±º||¬≤

### Anamoly detection
Anomaly Detection is the technique of identifying rare events or observations which can raise suspicions by being statistically different from the rest of the observations. Such ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù behaviour typically translates to some kind of a problem like a credit card fraud, failing machine in a server, a cyber attack, etc.
* To apply anamoly detection we use gassuian distribution/normal distribution
### Anamoly detection vs Supervised learning
### Anamoly detection
We will use anamoly detection when there are very small number of example that are positive(anamoly) and large number of negative example .Since small number of positive examples it is hard to learn from training examples.e.g: fraud detection
### Supervised learning
We will use supervised learning when large number of positive and negative examples are present. Since there are enough positive examples to train model and predict supervised learning is effective. e.g Email spam detection
* NOTE: Before using anamoly detection we have to make sure our data is normal.

### Recommender system
Recommender systems are a type of machine learning algorithm used to suggest items to users based on their preferences or behavior. These systems are widely used in various applications like e-commerce, movie streaming platforms, music apps, and more.
### 1.Content based Recommendation
In content-based recommender systems, the algorithm recommends items based on the similarity between the content/features of the items and the user's preferences. The similarity is typically computed using techniques such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Here's an overview of the mathematical steps involved:

* a. Feature Representation: Each item and user is represented as a feature vector. Let's denote an item's feature vector as x and a user's preference vector as p. These vectors consist of numerical values that represent the attributes or characteristics of items or users.

* b. Similarity Measure: The similarity between two feature vectors, x and p, can be computed using cosine similarity. The cosine similarity between x and p is defined as:

similarity(x, p) = (x ¬∑ p) / (||x|| * ||p||)

where (x ¬∑ p) represents the dot product of vectors x and p, and ||x|| and ||p|| denote their respective Euclidean norms.

* c. Recommendation: To recommend items to a user, the system calculates the similarity between the user's preference vector and the feature vectors of all items. The system then ranks the items based on their similarity scores and recommends the top-rated or most similar items.
* üìöResources  
course:[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?page=1)
### Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems:
Collaborative filtering recommender systems make recommendations based on the preferences or behavior of other similar users or items. Let's explore the two main approaches: user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.

* a. User-based Collaborative Filtering:

In user-based collaborative filtering, the algorithm finds similar users based on their past interactions or ratings and recommends items that the similar users have liked. Here are the mathematical steps involved:

i. User Similarity: The similarity between two users, u and v, can be computed using techniques such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. The similarity score measures the likeness of their past interactions.

ii. Prediction: To predict a user's preference for a particular item, the system combines the ratings of similar users. The predicted rating, denoted as r_hat(u, i), for user u and item i is calculated as a weighted average of the ratings of similar users:
```python
    r_hat(u, i) = ‚àë (sim(u, v) * r(v, i)) / ‚àë |sim(u, v)|
#where sim(u, v) represents the similarity between users u and v, r(v, i) denotes the rating of user v for item i, and the summation is performed # over all similar users v.
```
where sim(u, v) represents the similarity between users u and v, r(v, i) denotes the rating of user v for item i, and the summation is performed over all similar users v.
iii. Recommendation: The system recommends items with the highest predicted ratings to the active user.
*  Item-based Collaborative Filtering:

In item-based collaborative filtering, the algorithm identifies similar items based on the past interactions or ratings of users. It then recommends items that are similar to the ones the user has already liked. Here's a summary of the mathematical steps involved:

i. Item Similarity: The similarity between two items, i and j, can be computed using techniques such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. The similarity score measures the likeness of user preferences for the items.

ii. Prediction: To predict a user's preference for a particular item, the system considers the user's past ratings for similar items. The predicted rating, denoted as r_hat(u, i), for user u and item i is calculated as a weighted average of the user's ratings for similar items:
```python
  r_hat(u, i) = ‚àë (sim(i, j) * r(u, j)) / ‚àë |sim(i, j)|

  #where sim(i, j) represents the similarity between items i and j, r(u,

### Normalization
Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.
### Limitation of collabrative filtering
How to 
* rank new items that few user have rated ?
* show something reasonable to new users who have rated few items ?
How to use side information about items or users:
* Item: Genre, movei stars, studion...
* User: Demorgraphics(age,gender,location), epressed prefernces,..
Note: This limitation of collabrative filtering can be addressed by content based filetring
### [Tensorflow implementation of collabrative filtreing](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/e34e047cf5b50496b478695c5aad219690b69b18/code/day32%20collabrative%20filetering%20for%20movie%20recommendation.ipynb)
### Content base recommendation
It uses both content and user data and using neural network create vector for content and vector for user and its dot product give prediction.
### Content base recommendation for large items.
When our website or app has large number of content to recommend like thousands and millon of item it is carried out in two steps:
#### 1.Retrival
From large number of content retrival is carried out for selective content for further ranking. for e.g:  
For movies recommendation:  
1.for 10 movies watched by user retrieve similar movies.  
2.for most viewed 3 genres find top 10 movies.  
3.find top 20 movies in country.  
At last combined retrived item in list and remove duplicated and items already purchased.   
#### 2.Ranking
Apply model to retrived data to find suitable item and display ranked item to user.   
Note: Retriving more items result in better recommendation but takes more time to analyse try it offline and find suitable number of retrival for better and relevant recommendations.

### Dimensionality reduction
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. In other words, it is a process of transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still preserves the essence of the original data
* Feature selection : Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the problem at hand. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important features. There are several methods for feature selection, including filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Filter methods rank the features based on their relevance to the target variable, wrapper methods use the model performance as the criteria for selecting features, and embedded methods combine feature selection with the model training process.

* Feature Extraction: Feature extraction involves creating new features by combining or transforming the original features. The goal is to create a set of features that captures the essence of the original data in a lower-dimensional space. There are several methods for feature extraction, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). PCA is a popular technique that projects the original features onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the variance as possible.
### Principal Component analysis(PCA)
Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical procedure that allows you to summarize the information content in large data tables by means of a smaller set of ‚Äúsummary indices‚Äù that can be more easily visualized and analyzed.
*  It works on the condition that while the data in a higher dimensional space is mapped to data in a lower dimension space, the variance of the data in the lower dimensional space should be maximum.

### Step by step calculation of PCA
PCA is used to reduce higher dimension data to lower dimension without losing it essence. PCA can be calculated in following steps:
* Mean centring data
* Finding covariance matrix 
* Finding eigen value and eigen vector 
* Eigen vector with largest eigen value has highest variance and is ready for selction.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.

* start in state s
* take action a(once)

Note: Behaving optimally means taking action which bring maximum Q(s,a).

### Random stochastic environment 
Due randomness and uncertainity in enviroment it becomes diffcult for reinforcement learning so to avoid this we caluclate Expected return(i.e average return) in placce of return only .

### Discrete state and continous state
* Discrete state : It is a state in reinforcement learning where the number of possible state are distinct and countable. Discrete state spaces are common in many RL problems, such as board games, puzzle-solving, and decision-making tasks with a finite number of states.
* Continuous state : It is a state in reinforcement learning where the number of possible state are in continous range . Continuous state spaces are encountered in various RL applications, including robotics, control systems, and real-world scenarios where states are represented by continuous measurements.
### Differences in Discrete and continous state
Discrete state spaces can often be represented using tabular methods, where the agent maintains a value function or a Q-table to learn and update action values for each state. On the other hand, dealing with continuous state spaces often requires `function approximation` techniques, such as using `neural networks, to approximate the value function or policy`. Continuous state spaces also pose challenges for exploration strategies, as the agent needs to explore a potentially infinite space effectively.
### Exploitation(greedy) VS Exploration
It also know as epsilorn greedy policy
* with probability 0.95, pick the action a that maximizes Q(s,a) - Greedy (Exploitation)
* with porbability 0.05, pick action a randomly. (Exploration)
* This means epsilon = 0.05
* Start with high epsilon and decrease gradually
### Refinement of reinforcement learning by minibatches and softupdate
### Mini batches
When we have large number of training examples our iterative process like gradient descent and other iterative process on reinforcement learning like trainin neural network becomes slower so we divide main training examples to differen subsets called mini batches
### Soft Update
Soft update in reinforcement learning refers to a technique used to refine the learning algorithm by updating the parameters of a target network gradually. This process involves interpolating between the parameters of the target network and the parameters of the online network.

### Califorina Housing Price prediction
Started my project on California housing price and cleared my concepts on data pipeling, Batch learning and Online learning, perfomed the fetching and loading of data with EDA to gain some insight on data.  
**NOTE**
* **Batch learning vs Online learning** : Batch learning is commonly used when the dataset can fit into memory and when the computational resources are sufficient to process the entire dataset at once. It is often used in offline scenarios where there is no need for real-time or incremental learning.  
Online learning is particularly useful when dealing with streaming data or when the dataset is too large to fit into memory. It allows for real-time learning and adaptation as new data arrives. Online learning algorithms often have lower memory requirements and can adapt to concept drift, which is the phenomenon where the underlying data distribution changes over time.
* **Cost for linear regression** : Most of the time cost for linear regression is calculated by Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) but when data has lots of outlier we use Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Different methods of sampling :
1.Random sampling 
2.Systematic sampling
3.Stratified sampling
* Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling can be useful in train-test split when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In this case, the dataset may have significantly different proportions of classes or subgroups. By using stratified sampling, we can ensure that the training and test sets maintain the same distribution of classes or subgroups as the original dataset. This helps to prevent bias and provides a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.

### California Housing Price Prediction
### Expermenting with attribute combinations 
* I created some new combination of feature like room per house , bedroom ration, population per house and found that room per house has done well then other features, it got some high negative correlation that indicated the less bedroom ratio more the price.
* Also Prepared data for machine learning algorithm by separating the features and target, and perform cleaning of data, replced missing values by filling it with median as it is less destructive.
![code for data cleaning](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/1a4f6b1318fd7e320d8673a0cd35d2e4e16149df/images/day42%20californina%20data%20cleaning.png)
### Use of Simple Imputer
* The benefit of using SimplImputer is that it will store the median value of each feature: this will make it possible to impute missing values not only on the training set, but also on the validation set,the test set, and any new data fed to the model.

### Handling of text and categorical data
* Text and categorical data can be handled by using ordinal encoder and One Hot encoding but incase of ordinal encoder it think data nearby data are more similar than far data which is not the case in Oceanproximity so we use onehot encoding.

### Feature Scaling
* Feature scaling is one of the most important transformation you need to apply to  your data. Without feautre scaling most model will bias one feature with another. Two ways of feature scaling are : 1.Min-max scaling  2.Standarization.
* `Never use fit() or fit_transform() for anything else than training set.`

### Select and train a model
* I trained some model like LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor and found out RMSE very high in LinearRegrssion which indicated underfitting and RMSE 0 in DecisionTreeRegressor which was heavily overfitting and RMSE was comparatively low on RandomForestRegressor.So, I  find that RandomForestRegressor can be a good choice

* Today I revised my classification concept on Multiclass Classification, error analysis, Multilabel Classification, Multioutput Classification.
* Multiclass classifier are capable of handling more than two class. Some of the algorithm that does multiclass classification are: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier and GaussianNB. Also can be done using multiple binary classifier like SGDClassifier and SVC.    
1.One Vs All (OVA/OVR): In One Vs All classification there are N Classifier model for N classes. Model with highest score is selected for particular class calssification.  
2.One Vs One (OVO): In One Vs One classification N classes have N*(N-1)/2 classifier model. In this, we have one classifier model for each class against every other class.   
* Also performed error analysis using confusion matrix
* Implemented Multilabel classification : A classification system that
outputs multiple binary tags is called a multilabel classification system. 
* Multioutput Classification : It is a classification that has multilabel and each label can have multiple class.
Below is the implementation of what I have learned today.

# Day48
* Today I dived deep into training model and what happen underhood the  sickit learn model with help of simplest Linear regression model and learned about minimizing model cost function using gradient descent.
* Gradient descent is used to find best parameter for reducing cost function. tips:`while using gradient descent all features most have same scale e.g use standardscaler or it will took very long time to converge`. Batch gradient descent takes whole batch of training data at each steps so it is terribly slow during large datasets.
* To solve the problem of Batch gradient descent we use stochastic gradient descent as named suggest step of this gd is random and stochastic gradient descent picks a
random instance in the training set at every step and computes the gradients based on it rather than taking whole data. But since it is random the steps may never settled to optimal minimum so this can be solved by decreasing learning rate gradually know as simulated annealing. `To use stochastic gradient descent with linear regression we can use SGDRegressor`.
* Mini-batch GD com‚Äê
putes the gradients on small random sets of instances called mini-batches. The main
advantage of mini-batch GD over stochastic GD is that you can get a performance
boost from hardware optimization of matrix operations, especially when using GPU

* Today I revised my concept on polynomial regression, learning curve, and about the condition of underfitting, overfitting and it solution.
* Polynomial regression model is used for non-linear data, we used cross-validation to see how our model is performing to check whether it is underfitting or overfitting, it can be also checked in polynomial regression with the help of Learning curve. If the model is underfetting it is better to add some new features or to use different model but adding more data doesnot help in underfitting and IF the model is overfitted it can be solve by regularization.

* Today I learned about Lasso Regression also known as L1 regularization and elastic net regression. Lasso Regression is used in case of high dimensional data and it can perform dimensionality reduction by setting coefficient zero of less important feature on increasing regularization paramter lambda which cannot be done by ridge regression.
* Elastic Net regression : This regularization term is the middle ground of both Ridg and Lasso it is calculated as weighted sum of both ridge and lasso regularization term, elastic net is preffered when more features have strong correlation or number of features is greater than training instances.
* Early stopping : A very different way to regularize iterative learning algorithms such as gradient
descent is to stop training as soon as the validation error reaches a minimum. This is
called early stopping.

* **Support Vector Machine:**
SVM is a popular machine learning model that does linear or non-linear classification, regressio and even novelty detection and it perform well with small and medium datasets.The core idea of SVM is :<br>
1.Start with lower dimension data<br>
  2.Move data in higher dimension<br>
  3.Find a support vector classifier that separates the higher dimension data.<br>
* Kernel function : It is  function that transform data from lower dimension to higher dimension to find support vector classifiers. some of them are : Linear kernel, polynomial kernel, Radial bias function (RBF) kernel and sigmoid function.
* Kernel trick : Calculating the high dimensional relationships without actually transforming the data to higher dimension is called kernel trick. It reduces the mathmatical computation.
 ![Implementation of SVM](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/16e98e7906623a887151e7860bf334d9b598bc01/images/day53%20svmpart1.png)

* **Polynomial Kernel :** The polynomial kernel is a kernel function that calculates the similarity between two data points in a feature space using a polynomial function. It is defined as:
K(x, y) = (Œ± * x^T y + c)^d
![formulas](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/24759b9895374f5330ffa21be484128280046124/images/day54svm%20formula.png)
* **RBF Kernel :** The RBF kernel, also known as the Gaussian kernel, is a popular kernel function that measures the similarity between data points based on their radial distance in a feature space. It is defined as:
K(x, y) = exp(-Œ≥ * ||x - y||^2)
* Both the polynomial kernel and the RBF kernel leverage the kernel trick, which is a method used in machine learning to implicitly transform data into a higher-dimensional feature space without explicitly calculating the transformed features. The kernel trick allows algorithms to efficiently operate in this higher-dimensional space by only computing the kernel function values between data points.

* Today I spended my time revising concept on decision tree from book and implementing it. Decision tree can perform both classification and regression task and are the fundamental unit of random forest which is one of the most important algorithm in machine learning.Decision tree uses entropy and gini impurity to look how model is doing.Gini impurity is default in decision tree classifier and best in case of large dataset as computationally it is faster than entropy while entropy provide more balanced classes.
* Regularization : Regularization can be done in decision tree by reducing freedom to decision tree and controlling following parameter like max_leaf_nodes:Maximum number of leaf nodes,
min_samples_split:
Minimum number of samples a node must have before it can be split, 
min_samples_leaf:
Minimum number of samples a leaf node must have to be created,
min_weight_fraction_leaf:Same as min_samples_leaf but expressed as a fraction of the total number of
weighted instances.
* Increasing min parameter and reducing max parameter regularize decision tree.

* **Decision Tree for regression:** Decision tree for regression is also similar to classification decision tree it recursively create split until the pure class is obtained. The selection is split is done by information gain using variance reduction.
* Also learned to reduce max_depth and increase min_sample_split and min_sample_leaf to overcome overfitting in decision tree of regression.
* Sensitivity to axis rotation : Decision tree does well when split is perpendicular to axis but when split is not perpendicular to axis data may not generalize well so we use scaling and pca to transform data and genralize it.<br>
* Hyperparameter tuning in decision tree result in high variance which is solved by averaging many decision tree known as ensemling and such ensemled tree is random forest which one of the popular and widely used ml algorithm.
Implementation of them is given below hope you get some insight.

* **Voting Classifier**: voting classifier train different model and either get prediction based on majority vote called hard voting or get prediction based on probability of each model prediction and averaging it called soft voting. `for soft voting we have to set hyperparameter as 'soft' and for svc you have to set probability hyperparameter to True.`

### Boosting
* Boosting basically trains the predictors sequentially each trying to correct it predecessor.Some of the popular boosting method are Ada boosting and gradient boosting.
* Ada boosting : Ada boost focuses more on the training instances that the predecessor underfit sequentially and works on updated weight. If ada boositng overfit it can be regularized by reducing the number of estimator or number of boosting stages.
* Gradient boosting : It also works sequentially but instead of updating training instances weight it works by fitting the predecessor on residual error of previous model.
Implementation of boositing is shown below hope you gain some insight.

Dimensionality reduction is process of reducing dimension of data without losing it essence and it is done to speed up training and somtime to reduce noise. Two methods of dimensionality reduction are projection and manifold learning.
### PCA
It is the most popular technique for dimension reduction it reduce dimension by choosing hyperplane that is closest to the data by preserving variance.

### Image classifier using sequential api
* Today I learned to use sequential api of keras to create a model that classify mnist fashion dataset clothe images. I trained the model using sequential api with input layer that take image as input and convert it to 1D array and two hidden layer that has relu activation and third output layer with 10 classes and activation softmax for multiple classification and I compile the model and evaluated it and found around 88% accuracy and checked on frist 3 data which was predicted correct.

* Today I revised concept of vectorization, broadcasting in python and not using of rank 1 array in neural network. Vectorization is done with the help of numpy and it make computation faster by avoiding loop to run in C instead of python. Broadcasting helps to perform arithmetic operation between unsimilar shape vector and also learned to avoid rank 1 array in neural network instead use vectors with rows and column because unexpected broadcasting may happen in rank 1 arrray.These were some basic to clear before diving into deeplearning hope you get some insight from here.

# Deep learning foundation
### Perceptron trick
* Today I learned about simple perceptron trick in which random data is selected each time and classifer is moved if data is misclassified, but in cannot quantify the classifier and may not converge sometime so we use different lossfunctionn in perceptron
 #### Loss function in Perceptron
 * Different loss function like perceptron loss,hinge loss, relu to minimize loss function in neural network we use gradient descent as done previously in machine learning
### Gradient descent
 * In neural network gradient descent finding is not easy task due to local minima we have to choose correct learning rate to converge so we use a technique called adaptive learnign that chosses learning rate some of them are SGD,adam,RMSprop,etc.
 ### Backpropagation
 * This is done to minimize the loss by updating weights on the basis of gradient descent it utilize chain rule of calculus. In backpropagation we see rate of change of loss with change in weights. It optimizes neural network.
 ### Batching and regularization
 * In neural network trainining is done on batches to enable parallel processing and reduces computation complexity by utilizing vecotrization , it also find more stable gradient and reduces overfitting.
 * Regularization is done on neural network by early stopping and dropout of some neuron.

### Recurrent neural network (RNNS)
* RNNs are special neural network that takes sequential data like text,audio as input and apply a recurrence relation to process the sequence, RNNs uses same weight matrices everytime ,which allow them to maintain and utilize information from previous time steps while processing the current input.
  ![Rnnsimage](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/4ccc60d94814a7804ebf26426c379456393fd307/images/day72%20rnns.png)
### Encoding
* Encoding refers to the process of transforming an input sequence into a fixed-length vector representation or a hidden state that captures the information from the entire sequence.
[encoding](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/4ccc60d94814a7804ebf26426c379456393fd307/images/day72%20encoding%20nl.png)
### Embedding 
* Embedding refers to the process of representing categorical or discrete inputs, such as words in natural language processing (NLP), as continuous-valued vectors. Embeddings help capture the semantic relationships and similarities between different input categories.
### Simple RNN example :

### Backpropagation through time (BPTT)
* In RNN backpropagation involves finding the derivatives of the loss function with respect to each time step in the RNN sequence, and then propagating these gradients backwards through time to update the weight called BPTT.
### Gradient Issues
* Computing gradient in rnns can be challenging task because it computing gradient wrt to time state involves many factors of weight repeated gradient computation.
* If weight matrices is large (many values>1) explodint gradients happen and it is solved by:
     * gradient clipping : One common solution to address exploding gradients is gradient clipping, which involves setting a threshold for the gradients. If the gradients exceed the threshold, they are scaled down to maintain their magnitude within an acceptable range.
* If weight matrices is small (many values<1) vanishing gradients happen and it solved by :
  * Activation function : Using activation function like relu make derivative 1 whenever x>0 so it help to prevent vanishing gradient.
  * weight initialization : Using Identity matirces as weight and keeping biases o prevent vanishing problem.
  * Network architecture : Controlling which information to add and which information to remove using  gates in each recurrent network. i.e use of LSTM and GRU.
 * üìöResources

# Day74
### LSTM
* Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) it use gated method that selectively add or remove information with each recurrent unit. This architecture solve gradient vanishing problem. It use gate to control flow of information by
   * Forget : Get rid of irrelevant information
   * Store : Store relevant infromation form current input.
   * Update : Selectively update the cell state.
   * Output : Return a filtered version of the cell state.
### Self Attention
* Self attention hold the core concepts behind modern transformer based model . It main idea is `Attending the most important part of input`. It captures long-range dependencies and allow parallelization. 
![self attention image](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/7ee81140b9b382df230121902e00b1d966e84368/images/day74%20sellf-attention%20method.png)

### Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
CNN are deeplearning algorithm that takes images and videos as input and perfrom further analysis and processing on it trying to mimic human visual system.
* Convolutional layers: In CNN we use filters of features patches to scan images called convolution. Convolution is element wise matrix multiplication of image patch and filter and summing it up which produces feature map. e.g: In letter 8 we use filters of circle,For different feature of image we use different filters.
* Activation functions: After forming feature map we apply activation like Relu to introduce non-linearity in the network.
* Pooling layers: after activation function we use pooling to spatial dimensions which make computational faster, make network more robust for varations in input.
* Flattening : After downsampling of feature map we convert it into 1-D vector and fed it to conncected layer for classification.
* Training : The 1-D data is fed to conncected neural network and model is tarined for further prediction and classification. While training model large sample labelled data is used and model learn through backpropagation.
**To build more robust system we use image augmentation to generate different variation of image for training by scaling,rotating,distorting images**

# Day76
* Today I dive depper into each steps of CNN and learned more about parameter of each component and implemented it to create a simple CNNs.
    * I firstly created feature map using Conv2D with 32 filter and filter of 2x2 use relu for non-linearity and downsampled it by using MaxPool2D of size 2x2 and strides i.e movement of 2.
    * In second convolution I used 64 filter of 3x3 with relu for non-linearity and downsampled it using 2x2 pool with stride 2.
    * In last step I flatten the feature map into 1D array and use connected layer to make classification using softmax as activation function.
Hope you get more understanding by looking at code and architecutre of CNN simple implementation.

### R-CNN
* CNN can only classify one object at a time called image localization to solve this issue sliding window approach was issued which was heavy computationally because it create million of sliding window in a normal image. For solution of this Regional based CNN i.e R-CNN was issued which proposes some region using external algorithm called selective search and Convolution is performed in this region.
* To ensure accurate localization and avoid redundant bounding box proposals, R-CNN applies bounding box regression and a technique called non-maximum suppression (NMS).

### Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN
* Fast R-CNN is also object detection algorithm that is faster than R-CNN, because in R-CNN propose region i.e some thousand region were send to CNN but in fast R-CNN input image is send to CNN and after CNN it proposes region from feature map by using selective search algorithm and Region of Interest pooling is done and further prediction is performed.
* But In cases of Faster R-CNN image is send to CNN like fast-RCNN but selective search algorithm is not used instead of it Region based Proposed Network is used to detect object which was faster than selective search algorithm,.
### YOLO algorithm
* You Only Look Once , In this algorithm we take an image and split it into an SxS grid, within each of the grid we take m bounding boxes. For each of the bounding box, the network outputs a class probability and offset values for the bounding box. The bounding boxes having the class probability above a threshold value is selected and used to locate the object within the image.

### Generative modeling
* Generative modeling take training sample as input with some distribution and predict or generate new sample similar to that distribution.
### Auto encoders
* Automatic encoding or auto encoders simple change higher dimensional data into lower dimension latent space and reconstruct the data using decoder , provides lower dimension data, denoised data.
 ### Variational Auto encoders
 * VAEs are atuo encoders that has probablistic twist on traditional auto encoders, VAEs use mean and standard deviation to learn latent space based on gaussian distribution and decode the latent space to generate new sample data.

### Prior on the latent disribution
* Prior on the latent distribution means our assumption on how the data will be distibuted for latent variable, common choice will be gaussian distribution with mean= 0 , variance = 1 becaue it encourages even encoding on latent space and penalizes on the clusering of data i.e avoid memorization of data.
### Regularization and normal prior
* In vaes regularzation is done to obatined `continuity : points that are close in latent space are consider similar after decoding` and `completeness: sampling from latent space turn into meaningful content after decoding` .
![regularization and normalprior](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/0b285e04491e486991b61ce6708afaacef703858/images/day81%20regularization%20on%20prior.png)
### Reparametrization 
* In vaes reparamerization is done to allow backprop and gradient descent for training of vaes end to end.

### latent peturbation and entanglement
* Keep other variable fixed and increase or decrease single latent variable is latent peturbation and Latent entanglement refers to the interdependencies or correlations among the latent variables in a generative model. In some cases, the latent variables may be entangled, meaning that changing one variable can have an impact on multiple aspects or features of the generated output.

* GAN is made up of two model i.e Generator and Discriminator and they behave adversial role to eachother , where
   * Generator produces synthetic data samples from noise which is similar to real data and Discriminator takes real data and data produced by discriminator as an input and differentiate between fake and real data. Generator and Discriminator works on competitive manner, where generator try to produce good data samples that can fool discriminator and discriminator also improve itself to classify real and fake images. They work on improvement until the data produces by generator becomes as good as real one.
* After training process you can simply use this generator two generate new images that has been never seen before.

### Challenges for robust deeplearning
* Bias skewed data and Uncertainity i.e model doesnot know the answer can be challenging part for developing robust deep learning models.
* **Algorithmic bias** : There can be bias while selection of data i.e some group may be overrepresented while other may be underrepresented, Model bias can be present due to lack of proper benchmark and metrics, Deployment bias due to change in distribution of data overtime, Evaluation bias due to not accounting of subgroups, Intrepretion bias due to human error .
* **Class Imbalance**: Class imablance can be another major problem that create biasness in deeplearning model which doesnot lead to robust model.For example, in a medical diagnosis task, the majority class could be healthy patients, while the minority class could be patients with a rare disease. In fraud detection, the majority class could be non-fraudulent transactions, while the minority class could be fraudulent transactions.
This can be solved by:

### Debiasing VAES
* VAES should be debias for better performance and it is done automatically by increasing the sample probability of sparse region of distribution and undersampling dense region data.

### Uncertainity
* Uncertainity is the lack of confidence or ambguity in the predictions made by model due to some noise or incomplete data.
 * Aleatoric Uncertainity : It is the uncertainity on data itself due to noise or randomness and it cannot be reduced with more data or model improvement.
 * Epistemic Uncertainity : It is the uncertainity on model  due to incomplete data and can be reduced with more data and model refinement.

### Unsupervised retraining using stacked autoencoders
* In realworld we may find data that is unlabeled mostly and few portion is labeled of that data because labeling data is expensive and timeconsuming process , In such case we can train autoencoder on full data in phase1 and train the classification model on labeled data in phase 2 using parameter generated by autoencoder from lower layer.
### Tying weights 
When we have symmetrical autoencoder we can tie the weights of decoder layer to encoder layers this halves the number of weights in the model speeding up training and limiting the overfitting.

But this optimization has some problem like finding learning rate, rscheduling learning rate , limitation of control of learning rate in multidimension, local minimum , saddle points where slope becomes zero without reaching optimal minimum points.
* EWMA(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) : It is basically weighted average where past data weight get decreasing over time compare to latest data and it is mostly used with time series data. EWMA can be controlled by a paramter alpha , If we increase alpha It give more value to previous data and graph become more stable, If we give decrease alpha our previous data are less weighted and we get moody graph. Optimal alpah is consider to be 0.9 mostly .
# Day94 
* Today I learned about stochastic gradient descent momentum i.e (SGD momentum) which is used to tackle non convex gradient descent to find global minima , It is extension of SGD  in addition it take a term called velocity which is based on (EWMA)Exponentially Weighted Moving Average of gradient descent it means it move accounting previous gradient descent where latest gradient descent has more weights. It is controlled by a parameter alpha which if 0 act like normal SGD and increasing it increase the velocity , optimal value of this parameter is 0.9 mostly . SGD momentum is lot faster than normal SGD. The problem with this SGD momentum is oscillation of it after reaching global minimum which increases it time to get to optimal solution.

* Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) : This optimizers solve the oscillation problem of SGD momentum by damping the oscillation and it become more faster than SGD momentum. It basically update weight in two steps first by momentum and second by gradient or momentum look ahead which reduces oscillation .
![Nag](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/1d137af6368597f5fbf1e6f66a361af8c4f7c83b/images/day94%20nag_momentum.png)
* Adaptive Gradient(ADaGrad) : AdaGrad is an optimizer which use adaptive learning rate and use in case of different scales of features , sparse feature that is due to majority 0 value in feature which create different change in slope in different direction so gradient first move more toward feature that has high gradient update to reduce this learning rate is divided by term which reduces learning rate and make gradient descent convergence faster toward global minimum but due to the term that divides learning rate Gradient descent never converges to global minimum it reaches near it so due this flaw ADAgrad is not used with complex Neural Network It  is only used incase of traditional algorithm but intiuition of it is necessary to learn Adam and RMSprop optimizers.
 
# Day95 
* Today I concluded my optimizers learning by getting deeper intuition about the most use optimizer in deep learning that is Adam optimizer along with one of the best optimizer that can compete with adam i.e RMSprop optimizer.
* RMSprop : This solves the problem of ADaGrad that was not converging to global minimum by changing the learning rate over time. The learning rate has more weight in recent epochs as compare to previous epochs.
* ADAM optimizer : It uses the concept of both momentum and learning rate decay i.e divides learning rate decay by moving average and mulitply learning rate by momentum which makes it use to hill down the gradient descent faster like momentum and get to global minimum without oscillation like learning rate decay concept.

# Day96
* Today I dive deep into regularization of neural network and got more idea about  L1 and L2 regularization , how regularization reduces overfitting , Dropout regularzation, data augementation , early stopping for reducing overfitting and orthogonalization from course Deeplearning specialization .
* **Regularization** : It is use for reducing overfitting of model most popular way is L2 regularization which penalizes weight for being higher and reduces some of the hidden unit effect. It make model more linear and reduces complex  curve which result in overfitting. L2 doesnot completely make hidden unit zero but penalizes for having higher weight ,
* Whereas in case of **Dropout regularization** It knock out hidden unit randomly making more smaller neural network which reduces the overfitting problem but it has one downside that is it may hamper decreasing cost function so dropout should me made in such a way it doesnot hamper cost function mostly dropout is used with the Computer vision.
* ALso overfitting can be solved by having more data which is achieved by data augmentation.
* Also early stopping at point where devtest cost function stop decreasing reduces overfitting but it hamper gradient descent to reach optimal solution i,e It breaks orthogonalization which means focusing on one task independently without distrubing other i.e gradient descent and regularization.

# Day97
* Today I learned about normalizing input features to make gradinet descent faster , Vanishing and exploding of gradients, Checking of gradient descent properly before training model to see if it is working correctly with the help of numerical approximation of gradient i.e Gradient checking and practical implementation of gradient checking from course DeepLearning Initialization , I hope you do the same and here is short summary hope you get some idea: 
 * **Normalizing input features :** Normalizing Input features brings all features in same range and helps gradient desent to converges faster 
 * **Vanishing and exploding gradient** : In deep neural network if weight is too large or too small during back propagation, then weight may explode or  vanish respectively which make deep neural network learning difficult it can be solved with xavier inatilization also known as (glorot) , He initialization  or with other proper initialization of weight .
* **Gradient checking**  : Check the approximated and actual derivative of weight if there difference is 10^-7 then it is good to go if it is more debug. Gradient checking is not used in training , Include regularization term before gradient checking and use gradient checking without dropout and later use dropout.

# Day98
* Today I learned about batch gradient descent,mini-batch gradient descnet and way of choosing mini batch size , bias correction , Hyperparameters and Hyperparamters tuning to find better result from the course Deeplearning initialization and also spended some time implementing regularization from assignment.
* **Mini-batch size** : When training set are too large to be train on one epochs mini batch gradient descent can be used and selecting batch-size depends upon the computational capcity of gpu/cpu. It should not be too large and too small , It is choosen as :
   * If small training set use Batch gd.
   * Typical mini-batch size are in 2^n depending on cpu and gpu size.
   * Many researcher use largest batch size that can fit in gpu
* Where as Bias correction is necessary to handle initial bias in weighted moving average so that initial bias doesnot affect the whole curve.
* **Hyperparameter** : The most important hyperparameter is learning rate ,optimizer,activation function, hidden unit , batch-size,  learning rate decay as well as regularizaition strength i.e L1/L2,dropout rate and initialization method
* Also hyperparameter can be choosen in different method like using coarse to find hyperparamter , picking at random,grid search ,bayesian optimization.
* **Organizing Hyperparamter process** : It is done either by babysitting one model if computational power is limited or training many model at parallel if enough computational power.

# Day99
* Today I learned about batch normalization and its whole working process like normalizing activation outputs, fitting batch norm into neural network, batch norm at test time from course deep learning sepcialization and spent some time implementing it .
* **Batch Normalization** : Batch normalization is a technique for training very deep neural networks that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch. This has the effect of stabilizing the learning process and dramatically reducing the number of training epochs required to train deep networks. So it advantages are it make network stable,faster,has regularizing effect and due to batch normalization weight initialzation become less important. Batch normalization introduces four parameters: two learnable parameters (alpha and beta) that provide scaling and shifting effects, and two non-learnable parameters (mean and standard deviation). At test time it is done with the help of Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)  of mean and standard deviation 
* Here is a sample way of applying batch normalization in tensorflow :
![Batch norm](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/90d0717270579f1675e0fe47a776a9358a535511/images/day99%20batch_normalization.png)
* Also you can apply batch normalization after activation function and in some case it may perform well.

# Day100
* Today marks my 100 days of code achievement! I've never been this consistent before, and maybe because this field excites me to sit everyday and learn something new , and with each new algorithm I learn, it feels like  gaining new superpowers. Today I learned about structuring and optimizing machine learning projects using orthogonalization,single number evaluation metrics ,optimizing and satisficing metric from course deeplearning specialization.
* **Orthogonalization** : It is an system design property that ensures modification of an component of algorithm doesnot create a side effect to other components.
 For e.g : Early stopping any algorithm to prevent overfitting may create a effect on cost function so this is not consider better interm of orthogonalization.
* **Single Number evaluation metrics:** Evaluating between two different classifier can be bit confusing using precision and recall so single number evaluation metrics for them may be F1 score which can tell which classifier is best.
* **Optimizing and Satisficing metrics** : Optimizing metrics are those metrics that you want to maximize or minimize to get best possible outcome Whereas satisficing is the metrics that are used to ensure certain threshold or minimum requirement is met. In realworld examples combination of optimizing and satisficing metrics is used . for e.g : For any classifier algorithms its optimizing metrics may be F1 score or accuracy and its satisficing metrics may be runtime.

# Day101
* Today I continued my learning on structuring machine learning projects and learned about train/dev/test distribution its size and when to change dev/test sets and its metrics, comparing  with human level perfromance /bayes error and learned to create custom loss and use it  from the course DeepLearning specilization.
* **Managing Train/Dev/Test distribution** : Dev and test set should be of same distribution . Choose a dev set and test set to reflect data you expect to get on future and consider important to do well on.
* **Size of  Test and Dev set** : Set your test set to be big enough to give high conifence in overall performance of your system.
* **Things to remember to move in right direction while working on machine learning projects:**
   * When your metrics is not considering the problem you want to solve tweaks the metrics .
   * Orthogonalization on metrics : Define a metric to evaluate the model, worry separately on how to do well on this metrics.
   * If doing well on dev and test set but doesnot do well on your application change your metrics or dev/test set.
   * E.g : A few ml engineers spending months on tuning their model performance looking to dev set + metrics and when they check on test set with different distrbution it may not perfrom well .
   * Comparing with human level performance : When you surpass human level performance then the accuracy maynot get incrased rapidly and will not go above a line called baysian optimal error. When can follow avoidable bias and avoidable variance tactics by comparing training , test error and Human error proxy as bayesian optimal error. It means that our expectation of model will not be 0% error.
   * Avoidable bias is gap between bayes error/Human level error  and training error and can be controlled by using bigger network,training longer/better optimization. The gap betweeen training error and test error is variance problem and can be controlled by more data, regularization, hyperparameter search.
At last I Learned to create custom loss and create hubber loss that combine both mean squared error (mse) and mean absolute eror (mae) , to use custom loss after loading model we have to provide custom loss you can see from my code below :

* Today I learned about the best practices to do while developing a machine learning applications by reading  and evaluating my understanding from the case study of developing bird detection system in city of pacqueta , error analysis , directing to solve error with the help of misclassified dev set and some healthy habits of machine learning projects development.
* **Error Analysis :** Lets go through a example of cat classifier , If we build a cat classifier and found out few dogs were also classified as cat now what should we do , Should we spend time on dog classifier ?. The answer is ~ check 100 misclassified dev set and count how many are dog . the % of dog in misclassified is the percentage you can get your error down by. IF you got good decrement on error you can spend time on developing dog classifier also .
* Evaluating different mislabelled dev set in parallel : Look out the mislabelled percentage of differnet items and work on making classifier of items that has highest % of misclassification .
* Always remeber to apply changes you made on dev set , to test set so they both have same distribution .
* Also Build your first system quickly and iterate , after that you can work on error analysis and which direction to move for better performance.
Here is a sample of error analysis to get idea [click](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/Error-analysis-In-Ml-Projects)

# Day103
* Today I learned about training and testing on different distribution, Bias and variance with mismatched distributions and Addressing data mismatch from the course Deep Learning Specialization .
*  **Training and Testing on different distribution :** This can arise in different machine learning projects , we also choose our test/dev set that represent data distrbution that we will encounter on real world application , dev/test set are the data in which we want to perform better. For e.g : For a cat classifier we can get million of data that are very clear images of cat from internet  but in application user may upload blurry images from camera. So we should make our dev/test set compose of this blurry image from mobile and some amount of this data on training set.
*  In such situation our bias and variance maynot be seen on training error and dev error gap due to difference in data distribution . so we create a new set called `training-dev set which contains training data and dev data, training error and training-dev error will show variance situation`  which help to `see  variance problem` and the `gap between training-dev and dev/test  set will show data mismatch situation `.
*  **Addressing data mismatch :**  Data mismatched problem is addressed by getting more data of test/dev distribution using data synthesis , but during data synthesis be very careful about including tiny subset of data .
# Day104
* Today I learned about transfer learning and multiple task learning and when this technique should be used from the course DeepLearning Specialization.
* **Transfer Learning:** It is  a technique where knowledge learned from a task is reused in order to boost performance on a related task. It is mostly used when you have for the problem you're tranferring from and usually relatively less data for the problem you're transferring to . Also the task should have similar input . for e.g: A cat classifier model trained on 1 million data i.e  pretrainged model is used for dog classfication by finetuning i.e changing output layer or additional layer if needed
* **Multi task Learning:** It is a technique that enables single model to learn multiple taks at once . It is used when training on a set of tasks that could benefit from having share low level features. Usually amount of data is quite similar for each task. for e.g: A object detection that detects car,pedestrian, cycles,etc .

# Day105
* Today I learned about end to end deep learning approach and pipepline deeplearning approach and there use cases from course DeepLearning Specilaization.
* **End-to-end deeplearning** : It works well when the data is very large to map input x to the output y and in this approach it may be useful because it lets data speak and doesnot get limited on human perception. Less hand designing of component is needed in this approach.
* **Pipepline approach:** In this approach of deeplearning most important component are only focused for example if you need employee detection system you first take whole picture and keep the face picture and compares it with the orginal dataset to match rather than learning from whole image. It is very useful when large data is not available and It focuses on useful hand-designed component.
* Also Implemented transfer learning to create a classifier that detects simpson cartoon character using VGG16 architecture with some fine tuning.

# Day106
* Today I completed the prediction portion of Messy or clean room detection using VGG16 architecture by transfer learning, and revised  some computer visions topics like edge detection,padding and strides from course DeepLearning Specialization.
* **Padding** : In normal convolution operation edge are given less emphasis as compared to central area and image shrinks in each convolution to avoid this padding is used which make a external border around the image known as pad which avoid image shrinking and less emphasis on edge. It is of two type : valid means no padding and "same" means pad so output size is same as input.
Here is the some insights of making prediction of model that I saved which was previously trained using transfer learning.

# Day107
* Today I revised about convolution over volume , notation of convolution layer, Types of layers in CNN, Convolution Neural Network example (LeNet-5) and why convolution instead of neural network from the course DeepLearning Specialization and also spended some time developing cnn from scratch and built zero padding function and forward prop function.
* **Convolution over volume** : When some convolution operation is applied to the input images using some filters then some features are extracted . On a Single image of multi channel i.e RGB image a multichannel vertical edge detection and horizontal edge detection filter is applied which has same channel to images and new Ouput of dimension i.e displayed in images below will be obtained whose channel is equal to the number of filters.
* **Types of Layers in CNN** : Convolution layer, pooling layer, Fully connected layer or Dense layer.
* Input Image is taken an some filter is applied to detect feature for the input image called convolution operation , the layer formed is known as `convolution layer` in such layer `pooling layer` is applied  to reduce dimension this combination of convolution + pooling is taken as 1 layer and many such layer are obtained which generate a final convolution layer that is then flatten and provided to `fully connected layer` and at last require prediction is made.
* **Why Convolution** : Convolution is used instead of simple nn beacause: 
    * Parameter sharing : A feature detector that is used in one part is useful for another part which reduce required number of paramters.
    * Sparsity connections: Output values depends upon only a samll number of input.

* Today I Learned about some classical CNN architectures like LeNet-5(60k parameters), AlexNet(~60M parameters), VGG-16(~138M parameters) also learned about ResNets, 1x1 convolution, Inception architecutre, and also created pooling function for CNNs from scratch.
* **ResNet** : The Residual Network (ResNet) allows to train deeper neural network i.e many layer without exploding and vanishing of gradients by skipping connections, while skipping of connection the later activation must match dimension to the previous activation that may be changed by pooling, this matching of activation is done with the help of activation in later activation functions. So with the help of ResNet we can train deeper neural network that bring greater performance which was limited in theory before the invention of ResNet.
* **1*1 convolution** : 1x1 filters are used to decrease the channels , it reduces the channel equivalent to number of 1x1 filters used, which may be helpful since it reduce computational complexity and give more emphasis on important channels.
* **Inception** : The important features of input sometimes get distributed more locally and sometimes get distributed more globally, which may need different filter size to detect them properly, previously same size of filter was used throughout the architecutre but inception stacks different dimensional filter together and to reduce computational complexity it uses 1x1 convolution.

* Today I dive deeper into the intuition of depthwise separable convolution,bottleneck in MobileNetV2, MobileNets , MobileNetsV2, Efficient net from the course Deep Learning Specialization.
*  **MobileNets :** The main idea behind the MobileNets is low computational cost and can be used for mobile device and embedded vision applications. Instead of performing normal convolution MobileNets uses depthwise separable convolutions which is made of depthwise and pointwise convolution which help in reducing number of paramters.
*  **MobileNets V2 :** The mobile net V2 is the improved version of MobileNet which is made of input->expansion(point wise convolution that increases number of channel)-> depthwise convolution that has filters of fxf size and number of filters equal to channel of expanded conv-> projection which is aslo pointwise convolution that decreases channel-> output layer. This middle (i.e expansion->depthwise->projection) is also known as bottle neck reduces computational cost providing good performance in hardware limited scenario like mobile app , embeded system.
*  **Efficient net** : The Effiecient is another architecutre that provides flexibility to change resolution, depth and width of  convNet to get best performance within your computational budget.

* **Data augmentation :** The technique use to generate datasets of variation when datasets is limited by applying different transformation like mirroring, random cropping, rotating, shearing, color shifting .  It reduces overfitting problem and increase performance of model.
* State of computer vision : If you have more data than less hand engineering is required and If you have less data then you can use more hand engineering and transfer learning if needed.

# Day111
* Today I revisited object detection in deep learning and learned about object localization,landmark detection, Sliding window, YOLO : IoU,Non max suppression,anchor box from the course deep learning specialization.
* **Object Localization:** Detects objects and draw bounding box around them i.e location of the objects.
* **Landmark detection:** It is the process of detecting significant landmark withing the image, these landmark are the point or features of interest within the image such as corners, edges, object keypoints, facial features, or any other salient points that help describe the structure or content of an image.
* **Sliding Window by convolution**: Sliding window according to stride over image may be computationally costly so instead of it we use fully connected layer as convolution and create all possible sliding window at once and select the one with objects but this method maynot give accurate bounding box
* **YOLO algorithm**: This algorithm works well on detecting bounding box than sliding window and it is faster . In this algorithm we take an image and split it into an SxS grid, within each of the grid we take m bounding boxes. For each of the bounding box, the network outputs a class probability and offset values for the bounding box. The bounding boxes having the class probability above a threshold value is selected and used to locate the object within the image.
  * **Intersection Over Union:** IoU measures the overlap between ground truth bounding box and predicted bounding box.
    IoU= Area of Overlap/Area of Union.This IoU makes the preformance of YOLO better by providing more accurate bounding box.
  * **Non-Max suppression:** It selects the bouding box with maximum probability out of different bounding boxes.
  * **Anchor box**: When object of different aspect ratio is in the image then anchor box is used to detect them seperately

* Today I learned about Image segmentation, transpose matrix multiplication, U-net architecture and spended some time creating a CNN model to detects wether the person is similing and sign language detection using Sequential Api and Functional Api from the course Deep learning specialization.
* **Image Segmentation :** It is the method to label every single pixel instead of drawing bounding boxes in the images and used in automonous driving car, medical field. U-net architecture is one of the popular image segmentation archtitecture . It first use normal convolution and pooling in contraction and in expansion it use transpose convolution with skip connection that provides activation function of higher detailed low level spatial information. Then at last 1x1 convolution filter equal to number of classes to segment is used resulting output with dimension HxW equal to input and 3rd dimension equal to number of class to segment.
* **Functional API vs Sequential API** : Sequential API works very well with linear topology but for non-linear topology you need to use Functional API. I will share some code snippet that reflect way to use Sequential API and Functional API.

* Today I dive deep into the concepts behind facial recognition system like one shot learning , siamese network ,  triplet loss from the course deep learning specialization.
* **One-shot learning:** It is a classification algorithm that assesses the similarity and differences between two images. For example for face recognition of a person you get one image from camera and compare it with the image in database . You get some sorts of scores and if the least score is less than threshold ,you are recognized . Thus you don't need to train on thousand of images in different lightings so it is called one shot. This one short learning uses network called siamese network and has loss called triplet loss.
* **Triplet Loss**: Triplet loss is a loss function that recognize the similarity or difference between items. It uses groups of three items called triplets they are : anchor , positive(similar item) and negative(dissimilar item). The loss function encourages the embedding of anchor and positive item to be closer then the embedding of anchor and negative item at least by certain margin.

* Today I learned about face recognition technique as binary classification problem, Neural style transfer its cost function , Deep convnet learning from the course Deep learning specialization and spended sometime implementing resnet.
* **Face recognition as binary classification problem :** You have images of verified person in database and you can precompute the embedding of this images and the new images whose face has to be recognized is now embeded and this input image embedding and database embedding is handled by sigmoid function that takes z=Wx+b, where x is the difference of each elements of embedding give 1 if same and 0 if dissimilar face is found.
* **Neural style transfer :** It is the technique in which it have content image and style image , combines them together to generate a new image of content drawn in style refrence.
* At first the generated images is initialize as a  noise and after running gradient descent and minimizing the cost function iteration by iteration the generated image will look more like the rendered image that combines style and content image.
     * **Style cost function:** It is basically the euclidean distance of gram matrix of style image and generated image, where gram matrix is the correlation between activation in k and k' channel where k' means prime channel . Style in any layer is defined as correlation between activations across channels.

* Today I created ResNet-50 from scratch first I built convolutional block function that skips the connection and shortcut path has convolutional layer to equalise dimension of input and output and also used yesterday built identity block that skips connection but it should have same dimension of input and output and it doesnot have convolutional layer on shortcut path. Using this two function I built the entire ResNet-50 model inspired from the course DeepLearning specialization.
* **Convolutional_block : It skips connection , has convolutional layer in shorcut path to make input and output dimension equal**

* Today I implemented the MobileNet-V2 using transfer learning for image classification task and obtained around 78% accuracy on 5 epochs, since it was the binary classification problem I only used on neuron in dense layer . The overall purpose of using MobileNet-V2 was its tradeoff on accuracy and performance , since it get run in small memory because of depthwise separable convolutions which reduces the number of trainable parameter . Below is the code snippet of transfer learning hope you get some insights reading it , I will put more concise explanation once I complete it fine tuning aiming more accuracy.

* Today I dive deeper into the YOLO model for object detecting , got better understanding about the underhood function like filtering the boxes , Applying Non max suppression to select the best bounding boxes among the confident one , using the IoU threshold to remove overlapped bounding box and overally how the image is converted to encoding by model and the encoding is changed to bounding box that detect objects with scores and classes .
* Below is the code snippet of working of yolo model

Let's breakdown the steps: 
* 1. Your Deep-CNN yolo models take image as input and give you the emedding as output
* 2. We will now take this embedding and convert it to the best bounding box,scores and class name using some of our custom functions.

## Yolo filter boxes : It returns the filter boxes above the threshold from all H_image*W_image*anchor_box ,
## IoU : It is a function used  in non-max suppression to remove boudning box above the IoU threshold.

     * Samping novel sequences was using np.random.choice on output softmax probability to pick any random choice and feeding it to input of next time state.
     * GRU was the more simpler version of LSTM which used two gates i.e Update gate and Reliablity Gate wheras LSTM used 3 gate update,forget and output gate. Simpler RNN were not able to capture the long range dependecny so LSTM and GRU model were used.
     * GRU is used for simpler task that need less computation whereas LSTM is more powerful and computational heavy.
     * Bidirectional RNN has ability where output layer can get information from past and fututre state, BRNN combined with LSTM and GRU are used in many task.

* Word2vec/skipgram uses the technique of taking one word as context and taking random target word to calculate P(context|target) but it also has to calculate softmax for large number of vocabulary so it uses negative sampling that takes one positive sample and k negative sample 2<=k<=20 which reduces computation.

* Today I learned about Length normalization , beam search algorithm and error analysis in Beam search
* Length normalization is basically dividing the log of probabilites by length of the sentence Ty , using log result in more stable output because the multiple are added on log ,
* Beam search algorithm as we already know is used to find the most likely sentence it has parameter B which if become large result in better result but slower and if small result in worse result but faster so proper tradeoff is required.
* Also learned about error analysis with beam search, If the probability of human translation is greater than probability of algorithm translation then algorithm choose less likely sentence so Beam search is at fault and if the probability of algorithm is greater than human translation then RNN fault and by looking at fraction of this we decide to mitigate error i.e RNN fault solve or Beam search fault solve.
* Also scratched my head on Retrieval Augmented Generation which basically solve the hallucination of LLM like whem LLM doesnot have source to answer or LLM is outdated to user query than it may give its madeup answer which may be wrong so RAG add a source where the response of LLM is checked to give the correct answer to user without hallucination.

# Day145 
* Machine learning is not always about creating notebook , preprocessing data and running model making predictions in a complete machine learning cycle there is requirement of well organizing your project from creating virtual environment , to setting up things in case of launching your own packages
* so, today I learned about creating setup.py  to make your python projects a complete packages and using Hypen e dot I was able to achieve setup.py installation from installing requirements.txt as 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
* In a simple words I learned to create pacakges.
* Below is the code snippet of setup.py hope you have good time creating your own packages.

# Day147
* From today I am going to continue my 300daysofdata toward the direction of nlp specialization embracing modern technology like llm. I have studied about RNN,LSTM ,GRU and transformer many time but this journey from now is gonna be more practical approach . I am going to start from text processing and will be learning newest technology like langchain and vectordatabase so if you are also planning to specialize in nlp lets get connected and start.
* Topics : Tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatization , Text preprocessing ,stop word, punctuation removal and text normalization, Spacy
* Hands on : Applied the above concept on project called Anime recommender system.

üí° Notes:
1. Tokenization  means breaking the sentence into words or part .
2. Lemmatization is the process of reducing the words into its root form or 'lemma'.
3. Stemming is the process of reducing the word into its stem which is almost similar to lemmatization but it is less accurate and computationally faster than lemmatization.
4. Removing stop words is the process of removing words like 'and' , 'the' which don't convey much meaning.
5. Text normalization is the process of converting text to more consistent form like converting to lowercase.

Below is the sample code snippet that cover all concepts hope you have some good time understanding this basic :

# Day148
* Topics : Bag of words, TF-IDF, World2Vec i.e text representation.
* Hands on : Using Spacy to build toxic comment classifer
üí° Notes:
* Bag of words : where each element corresponds to the frequency of a word in the document.
* TF-IDF : In this technique, The importance of a term is based on its frequency in the document and its rarity across the entire corpus
* World2Vec: Word2Vec represents words as continuous vector embeddings in a high-dimensional space.
üéØNote to take: Out of this 3 method Word2Vec is more advanced which capture semantic realtion and require large data .
üß† Also implemented this text preprocessing and text representation to build toxic comment classifier below is the code of this classifier using count vectorizer which was doing decent but I found that when the word hate was coming it wrote it as toxic even the comment was not toxic, so I have decided to use word2vec next and see the result. Hope have some good time build you own toxic comment classifier.
* [Code snippet of toxic message classifier](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/300DaysOFMachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/c74757d6d9d61fb99d0bb0a4d1609037776a1d5f/images/day2.pdf)
# Day149
* Topics : World2Vec embedding and its implementation in toxic comment classifier which should resulted in better result than previous count vectroizer representations.
* In my today learning and coding I found that my toxic comment classifier was doing well on the normal easy comments but for the comments like "Hate is everywhere but I don't hate you" it identified it as toxic comment which is not actually toxic. So I thought it was not capturing context like don't which actually was true becuase they where removed in stopword then I modified my stopword even after that there was no change and I use 100 dimension word2vec embedding instead of 25 dimension word2vec embedding which for sure increase some accuracy but didn't did well on that particular comment which should be non-toxic.
‚ö†Ô∏è SO I ended today session with challenge which for sure I will try to solve some of my next step will be using sentence transfomer.
# Day150
* Topics : sentence transformer and its implementation.
* Notes :  Today I learned about sentence transformer and implemented to calculate the similarity  between two sentences.
* Sentence transformer  : It is a model that convert sentence into a vector representation that capture semantic information, making them useful for various NLP tasks such as similarity comparison, clustering, and information retrieval.
* Below is the code snippet of implementing sentence transformer I hope you have good time implementing sentence transformer in your own applications.

# Day151
* Topics : Implementation of sentence transformer into toxic message classifier
* Today I implemented sentence trasnformer embedding for representing sentence for toxic message classifier and train the logistic regression which as expected showed the improvement in accuracy to then that of word2vec embedding and also designed own custom words to prevent more context in sentence for some trick comments.
* Below is the code snippet of toxic message classifier hope you get some insights from my learning.

# Day152
* Today I revisited the concept of transformer understanding it from the concept like embedding how the attention , multi head attention provide better embedding for words like apple which can be apple company or apple fruit from context of sentence and also played with hugging face pipeline for sentiment analysis and text generation. I will spending more time learning transformer block and how it is used in large language model.

# Day153
*  Today I revised my understanding on attention-mechanism , transformer language models from the cohere LLM university course.
* Attention mechanism in shorts : Sometime the word like apple can convey two meanings for e.g it can be company and fruit, which is consider by attention mechanism it distinguish between whether the apple is company or fruit by looking at the sentence context.
### Let's talk about transformer language model in short as possible : It architecture is as follows 

* input -> (Tokenization)-> (embedding) ->(positional encoding) -> (series of Transformer block { attention component and feed forward layer }) -> (softmax layer) -> output
- Tokenizer: Turns words into tokens.
- Embedding: Turns tokens into numbers (vectors)
- Positional encoding: Adds order to the words in the text.
- Transformer block: Guesses the next word. It is formed by an attention block and a feedforward block.
- Attention: Adds context to the text.
- Feedforward: Is a block in the transformer neural network, which guesses the next word.
- Softmax: Turns the scores into probabilities in order to sample the next word.
### Macro precision,recall and F1 score for multilabel classification
Alsoe learned about Macro precision , macro recall and F1 score which is calculated by calculating precision recall and F1 score for each class and averaging it by number of classes in classification.

* **Domain adaptation** : It is the process of finetuning pretrained language model in domain data which makes it suitable for downstream task(i.e task you want to solve)
* **Knowledge distillation** : Tranfering knowledge from large model to small  model is called knowledge distillation which make the small model more powerful and save computational cost.
* **Masked Language Model** : This model predict the words that should be filled in the blank. It is also used popularly for finetuning in domain specific data.
* **Preplexity** : It is simply the exponent of binary cross entropy loss , less preplexity means better langauge model.
* Below is inferencing snippet please check my github link for full finetuning process

# Day187
* Today I was astonished reading the paper of alpaca, revealing secret recipe for preparing datasets to finetune instructions following model i.e LLama7B to get some models like text-davinci-003 under very low cost i.e Alpaca Model.
* Simply , The Llama7B was finetuned by 52k instructions supervised data that was generated using text davinci 003 by providing 175 sample of supervised instructions dataset by human and after finetuning alpaca model was obtained which was very small in size to text davinci 003 but the performance was almost near to it even better in some case.
* So this research showed the way to **obtain high quality instructions following model** generated using **high quality pretrained model i.e LLama model** and **using high quality instruction following data i.e using existing languge model to automatically generate instruction data**

# Day188
* Today I dive deep into reading research paper named **WizardLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions** where I get to know about evol instructions. Below is the summary of what I learn , you can enjoy this summary in just few mins
* Training LLM on closed domain instructions i.e specific type of instructions resulted in  two drawbacks :
                * 1. No diversity, common instructions
                * 2. Instructions only ask for one tasks wherase in reallife human instructions have muliple tasks.
  * So to avoid this LLM like openai where trained on opend domain specific task using human annotators which was a bit time consuming and expensive and the instruction where skewed towards easy and medium type of instructions in comparison to complex instructions.
  * So here comes the hero **evol_instruct** which is a novel technique to automate instructions generation using LLM which generate more balanced open domain instructions of various diffculty level to improve performance of LLMs.
  # How it generates instuctions.
  * It generates instuctions in two ways by depth evolving and breadth evolving .
     * In depth evolving complex instructions where generate by adding constraints, deepening, concretizing, increasing reasoning steps and complicate inputs
     * In breadth evolving new complex instructions wherer generate to give diversifications
    ![](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/300DaysOFMachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/528f9b138eb3a2904301bb7a691c4dbd9a50b9fa/images/day187%20evol_instructions_running.png)
 # Results of evol instructions.
 * Instructions generate with evol-instructs where superior to human generate ones and WizardLM trained using evol-instruct outperform chatgpt under complex test instuctions.

# Day189
* Today I dive deep into understanding the difference between open domain instructions fine tuning and closed domain instructions fine tuning.

* Closed domain instructions finetuning fails in real world scenarios where the open domain diversified instruction finetuning on  language model works well.

* So evol instruct is used to generate such open domain diversed intrcutions dataset, Its pipeline consists of instruction evolver to create variation and complexity in instruction using LLM , whereas Instruction eliminator filters instruction that fails to evolve.

# Day190
* Today I spended my time learning to create Instructions dataset to fine tune LLM , where I found out that weight & biases provides a great visulazation of model training and its evaluations . Also weight and biases is great platform to observed or analyze your data.
* Also while preparing data I learned about Packing where token id is putted together equals to max lenght of llm model which make model finetuning more memory efficients.
* Completed reading the wizardLM whose main theme is use LLM to create complex instructions datasets which is more balance and superior to human created one because of time and skewness of human create data towards the simpler one.
* Below is the sample code snippet of preparing datasets and using wandb.log to observe datasets. I will be finetuning LLama model in coming days I hope you have good time reading this.

# Day191
* Today I dive deep into implementing packing instead of padding , also used weight&biases for saving packed data and I was happy with features provided by wandb  like data version control and provding api to your dataset, packing generally add next sequence once the current sequence is finished to fill the window size instead of adding unvaluable padding tokens which generally reduces the computation and make finetuning more efficient as the number of sequence will be reduced also implemented packing.

* **Packing** : Packing is a technique  for LLM inputs  to concatenate multiple tokenized sequences together into a single input, which we can call a ‚Äòpack‚Äô. It eliminates padding which donot contribute to langugage understanding

* Today I dive deep into understanding different concepts of decreasing memory while finetuning LLM models like freezing layers, freezing embeddings, gradient checkpointing and implemented them in code for finetuning Llama7B model.
* If you are also interested in optimizing memory while finetuning LLM you can read following topics.
* **Freezing layers to save memory**  : Transformer based LLM like LLama2 are stack of identical 32 layered model so if you cannot fit whole model in GPU you can train last layer like 8 last layer which is responsible for predicitions.
* **LoRA** : Also you can train whole model using efficient parameter finetuning technique like LoRA.
* **Freezing embeddings** : Freezing embeddings can also decrease memory usage.
* **gradient checkpointing** : Gradient checkpointing recalculates activations of certain layers during backward pass to save some memory taking addtional computational time.
* **Automatic mixed precision**  : float16 or bfloat16 makes model training faster since the model are trained on half precisons.
* Below is the code snippets where I implemented above techniques like gradient checkpointing, freezing embeddings and model layers to make finetuning possible in GPU efficient way.

# Day195
* Today I learned more on chat template , using different format than the format on which chat model is trained on is the silent performance degradation so making sure the correct format is used is necessary for better performance which is where chat template comes in.

# Day196 
* Today I learned about interesting topics to handle the edge case while building RAG systems i.e maximal marginal relevance (MMR)
* MMR selects examples based on a combination of which examples are most similar to the inputs, while also optimizing for diversity. It first select the most similar one then penalizes other similar case to create diversity.
* Below is the sample example of mmr hope you gain some insight from it.

* **SFT** : Models are trained on labelled data and weight will be adjusted to  minimize the loss

* **RLHF** : Model learn by recieving feedback from human, a reward model train on human prefrences is used to optmize agent's policy using reinforcement learning through algorithm Like PPO.

* While SFT dataset with similar format to prompt brings greater results.

* Today I dive deep into the Mistral7B where I learned about sliding window attention and its benefit over vanilla attention also started to prepare datasets for finetuning Mistral7B .
* Sliding Window attention : It has fixed size window that slides instead of linearly increasing window size in vanilla which reduces computational power and lower latency in inference.
* Rolling buffer cache in Mistral overwrites old token with new tokens when cache size is overtaken.
#### Preparing datasets for finetuning tips.
* Removing samples with larger token size accoriding to context size of model you are finetuning.
* Removing similar output samples using embedding to measure similarity.

# Day206
* Today I learned about the KV cache techniques in detail with implementation which is one of the ways for reducing inference time in LLM by reducing subsequent token generation time.
* In simple words during token generation past key values is also returned with token id then the token id with past key values is passed to model as input which reduced redundant calculation of key values and include some concatenations only.

* **Code** :

# Day207
* Today I learned about Batching tokens in LLM for higher throughput in LLM inference.
* **Batching** : Batching tokens result in higher throughput but also increase latency so a good tradeoff latency and throughput can be maintained by selecting optimal batch size.
* ü•≥Checkout the Plot of tradeoff between throughput and latency with respect to batch size and which batch size would you select ?

# Day208 
* Today I learned about Continuous Batching which one of the method that has minimal latency and higher througput also spended some time reading about the composition in langchain like tool and customizing default tools.
* **Continous Batching** : The core idea behind it is that continuous batching swap out requests from the batch that have completed generation for requests in the queue that are waiting to be processed.
* Below is the implementation of my learning about tool, toolkit and defining custom tools.

# Day209 
* Today I dive deep into understanding the details of Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning(PEFT) using LORA and QLORA which reduces the memory requirement by 90% with achieving the performance close to the full finetuning.

### For Full finetuning 7B models we need to allocate per parameter
* 2 bytes for the weight
* 2 bytes for the gradient
* 4 + 8 bytes for the Adam optimizer states
#### i.e 7b * 16 = 112 GB(excluding intermediate hidden states) which makes finetuning less accesible so here comes PEFT methods.
 * PEFT methods reduces the trainable parameters of models without degrading performance.
### While using QLORA with adam optimizer using a base model and mixed precision method mode, we need to allocate per parameter as :
* ~0.5 bytes for the weight
* 2 bytes for the gradient
* 4 + 8 bytes for the Adam optimizer states
#### 14 bytes per trainable parameter where trainable parameter is reduced with QLora
