# Day1 
### 1. Supervised learning
Learns from being given `right answers`.  
Supervised machine learning is based on the basis of labeled data.First the data is fed to the model with both input and output and later on test data is given to make prediction by model. 
some algorithm used in supervised learning with their uses are :  
* Regression : House price prediction.
* Classification : Breast cancer detection.  
### 2. Unsupervised learning  
Learns by finding pattern in unlabelled data.
Unsupervised learning is different from supervised learning as it is not provided with labelled data.The algorithm work by finding pattern in data.  
some algorithm used in unsupevised learning with it uses are:
* Clustering : Grouping similar data points together e.g: grouping of customer , grouping of news,DNA microarray.
* Anomlay detection: Finding unusal data points e.g: fraud detection , quality check.
* Dimensionality reduction : Compress data using feweer numbers e.g : Image processing.

### Univariate Linear regression  
Univariate linear regression has one dependent variable and one independent variable. With the help of indendent variable also known as input,feature we predict the output. Firstly we provide training set to our model and later on we predict the output using training set.
### Cost function   
A cost function is a measure of how well a machine learning model performs by quantifying the difference between predicted and actual outputs.  
`lower the value of cost function better the model`

### Learning rate
Learning rate `alpha` in gradient descent should be optimal.
* If learning rate is too small gradient descent may be too slow and take much time.  
* If learning rate is too large gradient descent may overshoot and never reach minimum i.e fail to converge,diverge.

### Feature scaling 
When you data features has very large range,too small range gradient descent may take large time so data is rescaled to normal similar range called feature scaling.
some popular feature scaling techniques are:  
* mean normalization
* Z score normalization

### Choosing correct learning rate 
First we make sure gradient descent is decreasing over the iteration by looking at learning curve if it is working properly we choose correct learning rate by starting with smaller learning rate and increase it gradually.

### Feature engineering 
Feature engineering means designing newfeatures by transforming or combining original features which maybe very important in prediciting the output.  
for e.g: we have to predict the price of swimming pool and we have length breadth and height of swimming pool as features now we can used feature engineering to create our new feature which is volume which is very important in predicting the price of swimming pool.
### Polynomial regression
Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:  
y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n   
It is used incase of non linear dataset.

### Classification
Classification is a type of supervised learning in machine learning, where the goal is to predict the class label of an input data point.For example, we may want to classify emails as spam or not spam, or classify images as cats or dogs.
### Logistic regression  
Logistic regression is a type of algorithm used for classification problems. It works by estimating the probability of an input data point belonging to a particular class. For example, it may estimate the probability that an email is spam or not spam, or the probability that an image is a cat or a dog.

To estimate these probabilities, logistic regression uses a mathematical function called the logistic function, which maps the input data to the probability space. The logistic regression algorithm then learns the relationships between the input features and the target class by adjusting weights, or coefficients, assigned to each input feature. These weights are adjusted to maximize the probability of the correct classification.

In the end, logistic regression outputs the predicted class for each input data point, based on the estimated probabilities. This can be useful for a wide range of classification tasks, from predicting diseases to detecting fraud.

# Day9
### Sigmoid function
The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1. It is commonly used in logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome. The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve and is defined as follows:

σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

where z is the input value to the function. The output of the sigmoid function, σ(z), is a value between 0 and 1, with a midpoint at z=0.

The sigmoid function has several important properties that make it useful in logistic regression. First, it is always positive and ranges between 0 and 1, which makes it suitable for modeling probabilities. Second, it is differentiable, which means that it can be used in optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. Finally, it has a simple derivative that can be expressed in terms of the function itself:

d/dz σ(z) = σ(z) * (1 - σ(z))

This derivative is used in logistic regression to update the model coefficients during the optimization process.

### Decision boundary
The decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y=0 and where y=1.It is create by our hypothesis function.
In logistic regression, the decision boundary is the line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates the different classes of the target variable. The decision boundary is determined by the logistic regression model, which uses the input variables to predict the probability of belonging to a certain class.

### Gradient descent in Logistic regression  
Logistic Regression Ŷi is a nonlinear function(Ŷ=1​/1+ e-z), if we put this in the above MSE equation it will give a non-convex function as shown:  
![loss function image](https://github.com/Utshav-paudel/MachineLearning-DeepLearning/blob/a3e7cb1c6715f32f4f2744083b8eb6f69374f56c/images/day10%20cost%20function%20in%20logistic%20regression.jpg)
* When we try to optimize values using gradient descent it will create complications to find global minima.

* Another reason is in classification problems, we have target values like 0/1, So (Ŷ-Y)2 will always be in between 0-1 which can make it very difficult to keep track of the errors and it is difficult to store high precision floating numbers.

The cost function used in Logistic Regression is Log Loss.
